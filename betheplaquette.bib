  abstract =      {We study the superconductivity in 2D fermionic systems near antiferromagnetic instability, assuming that the pairing is mediated by spin fluctuations. This pairing involves fully incoherent fermions and diffusive spin excitations. We show that the competition between fermionic incoherence and strong pairing interaction yields the pairing instability temperature T ins which increases and saturates as the magnetic correlation length ξ → ∞. We argue that in this quantum-critical regime the pairing problem is qualitatively different from the BCS one.},

This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed. Computer programs for the numerical implementation of this method are also provided with this article.},

In the weak-coupling regime the system undergoes a transition from a metallic to a band insulating state. For strong coupling, a transition from an AF insulating state to a singlet state occurs at ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0295-5075/85/3/37006/epl11604ieqn1.gif] {t_\perp/t\approx\sqrt{2}} , which is consistent with a competition between intra- and inter-plane Heisenberg exchange. We calculate the spin-correlation functions of the model and show that the picture of a transition to a singlet insulating state remains valid for intermediate coupling, independent of the presence of long-range AF order. The quasiparticle peak continuously disappears due to the suppression of the local spin fluctuations by formation of the coherent singlet state. The transition is accompanied by the opening of a spin gap in the dynamical susceptibility.},

The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined.},

  abstract =  {Proximity to a Mott insulating phase is likely to be an important physical ingredient of a theory that aims to describe high-temperature superconductivity in the cuprates. Quantum cluster methods are well suited to describe the Mott phase. Hence, as a step toward a quantitative theory of the competition between antiferromagnetism and d-wave superconductivity in the cuprates, we use cellular dynamical mean-field theory to compute zero-temperature properties of the two-dimensional square lattice Hubbard model. The d-wave order parameter is found to scale like the superexchange coupling J for on-site interaction U comparable to or larger than the bandwidth. The order parameter also assumes a dome shape as a function of doping, while, by contrast, the gap in the single-particle density of states decreases monotonically with increasing doping. In the presence of a finite second neighbor hopping t′, the zero-temperature phase diagram displays the electron-hole asymmetric competition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity that is observed experimentally in the cuprates. Adding realistic third neighbor hopping t″ improves the overall agreement with the experimental phase diagram. Since band parameters can vary depending on the specific cuprate considered, the sensitivity of the theoretical phase diagram to band parameters challenges the commonly held assumption that the doping vs Tc∕Tmaxc phase diagram of the cuprates is universal. The calculated angle-resolved photoemission spectrum displays the observed electron-hole asymmetry. The tendency to homogeneous coexistence of the superconducting and antiferromagnetic order parameters is stronger than observed in most experiments but consistent with many theoretical results and with experiments in some layered high-temperature superconductors. Clearly, our calculations reproduce important features of d-wave superconductivity in the cuprates that would otherwise be considered anomalous from the point of view of the standard Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer approach. At strong coupling, d-wave superconductivity and antiferromagnetism naturally appear as two equally important competing instabilities of the normal phase of the same underlying Hamiltonian.},

  abstract = {Abstract We present TRIQS/CTHYB, a state-of-the art open-source implementation of the continuous-time hybridisation expansion quantum impurity solver of the \{TRIQS\} package. This code is mainly designed to be used with the \{TRIQS\} library in order to solve the self-consistent quantum impurity problem in a multi-orbital dynamical mean field theory approach to strongly-correlated electrons, in particular in the context of realistic electronic structure calculations. It is implemented in C++ for efficiency and is provided with a high-level Python interface. The code ships with a new partitioning algorithm that divides the local Hilbert space without any user knowledge of the symmetries and quantum numbers of the Hamiltonian. Furthermore, we implement higher-order configuration moves and show that such moves are necessary to ensure ergodicity of the Monte Carlo in common Hamiltonians even without symmetry-breaking.

Computer: Any architecture with suitable compilers including \{PCs\} and clusters. Operating system: Unix, Linux, OSX. RAM: Highly problem-dependent Classification: 7.3, 4.4. External routines: TRIQS, cmake. Nature of problem: Accurate solvers for quantum impurity problems are needed in condensed matter theory. Solution method: We present an efficient C++/Python open-source implementation of a continuous-time hybridisation expansion solver. Running time: Tests take less than a minute. Otherwise it is highly problem dependent (from minutes to several days). },
